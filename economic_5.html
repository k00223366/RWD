                        <h2><a href="#"> Brexit already hitting businesses, UK survey finds up to 58% of respondents from Britainís biggest firms see negative impact</a></h2>
                        <h3>Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017, Mon Feb 6, 2017</h3>
                        <p class="first"> Despite a stream of positive economic data, an Ipsos Mori survey of senior executives from more than 100 of the largest 500 companies found 58 per cent felt last yearís vote was already having a negative effect on their business.
                        Just 11 per cent found the Brexit decision had meant a positive impact while nearly a third - 31 per cent - thought it had made no difference to their company.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="second">Business in this country is already feeling the pain of the economic upheaval of leaving the EU,î said Ben Page, chief executive of Ipsos Mori. ìThere is no sign that this is likely to ease this year.î
                        Company bosses have voiced concern about losing competitive advantage against European rivals if tariffs rise after Brexit, adding to the cost of producing and exporting goods.
                        Investors also appear to be waiting for greater clarity about the outcome of Brexit negotiations before committing funds to longer-term projects.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="third">Theresa May will this week face a rebellion by pro-European Tory MPs who fear that she could walk away from the negotiating table in Brussels without a deal, with potentially serious effects for business.
                        The prime minister has said she would prefer ìno deal to a bad dealî, raising the prospect of Britain leaving the EU to fall back on World Trade Organization rules, including tariffs.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3></h3>
                        
                        <p class="fourth">The Office for National Statistics reported last month that the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 last year, and was not yet showing any signs of the slowdown that many economists predicted would follow the vote to leave the EU in June.
                        But the less rosy sentiment from business is supported by economic forecasters, with Sir Charlie Bean of the Office for Budget Responsibility and former deputy governor of the Bank of England saying last week that the strong consumer spending seen after the Brexit vote in June was likely to fall away in coming months.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Bank of England figures show that consumer borrowing growth in December slowed to its lowest in more than two years, while consumer confidence has also dipped.
                        Two-thirds of the 114 FTSE 500 business leaders surveyed believe the business environment will become more negative over the next 12 months, while only 13 per cent believed the opposite.
                        A large majority ñ 84 per cent ñ said that it was ìvitalî to their business that the government handled Brexit negotiations well. But half said they were not confident in the governmentís ability to negotiate the ìbest deal possibleî with the EU for UK companies.

                        <p>
                        In order to be successful in a post-Brexit UK, the interviewees said they wanted the level and complexity of regulation to be reduced and for it to still be easy to recruit EU staff.
