The timing, duration and nature of British prime minister Theresa May’s visit to Dublin last Monday revealed much about the low priority which she and her government attach to engagement with Ireland on the implications of Brexit.
Her rhetoric was reassuring and the body language was diplomatically pleasing but the summit fell far short of the level of real engagement necessary at this transformative moment in British and Irish relations.
May’s early-evening trip to Government Buildings came at the end of a busy day and a hectic week for the prime minister.
She must surely have been jetlagged after high-profile visits to the new president of the United States and then to Turkey in the previous 72 hours.
She hopped over to Dublin from Cardiff where earlier that day she had held meetings with leaders and ministers from the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Ireland executives.
